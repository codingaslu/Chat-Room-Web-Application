## Chat Room Web Application

This is a Flask web application that provides a chat room functionality. The application allows users to either join an existing chat room by entering a room code, or create a new chat room. The chat room is implemented using Flask-SocketIO, which provides real-time, bidirectional communication between the server and the client. The application keeps track of the messages sent by the users in a given chat room and displays them in the chat room.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the application using `python app.py`.

## Usage
1. Enter your name on the home page.
2. If you want to join an existing chat room, enter the room code on the home page and click the "Join Room" button. If you want to create a new chat room, click the "Create Room" button.
3. Once you are in the chat room, you can send messages by typing in the input field and pressing "Enter" or clicking the "Send" button.
4. To leave the chat room, simply close the browser window or click the "Leave Room" button.
